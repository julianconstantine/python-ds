SUMMARY OF SEARCHING AND SORTING

Search Algorithms/Methods
1. SEQUENTIAL SEARCH
O(N) (linear) for ordered and unordered lists

2. BINARY SEARCH
O(Nlog(N)) (log-linear) for ordered lists only

3. HASH TABLE
O(1) (constant) if implemented correctly


Sorting Algorithms
1. BUBBLE SORT
O(N^2) (quadratic)

2. SELECTION SORT
O(N^2) (quadratic)

3. INSERTION SORT
O(N^2) (quadratic)

4. SHELL SORT
Between O(N) (linear) and O(N^2) (quadratic)

5. MERGE SORT
O(Nlog(N)) (log-linear)

6. QUICK SORT
O(Nlog(N)) (log-linear), but may degrade to O(N^2) (quadratic) in some cases
